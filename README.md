# Learning Journal with Flask

This application is a journal that allows users to keep track of their personal
learning progress.

Users can record how long they spent on a topic, what they learned, 
and any useful resources they may have come across.

A user must register and log in to create, edit, or delete their own entries.
An admin account has also been provided in the test data. Administrative 
accounts can edit or delete any entry, even those created by other users.

You can log into the test admin account with these credentials:

Email: ```admin@test.com```  
Password: ```password```
